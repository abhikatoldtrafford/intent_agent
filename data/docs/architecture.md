## Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our distributed microservices architecture. The system is designed to handle high throughput, provide low latency responses, and maintain high availability across all services.

### Design Principles

Our architecture follows these core principles:
- **Service Independence**: Each service can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate asynchronously where possible
- **Fault Tolerance**: Services are designed to handle partial failures gracefully
- **Observability**: All services emit metrics, logs, and traces for monitoring
- **Security by Default**: Authentication and authorization at every layer

## High-Level Architecture

The system consists of three primary layers:

### 1. Gateway Layer
The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests. It handles:
- Request routing to appropriate backend services
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling
- Request/response transformation
- API versioning

**Technology Stack**:
- Runtime: Node.js with Express
- Load Balancing: NGINX
- SSL/TLS Termination: Let's Encrypt certificates

**Performance Characteristics**:
- Target Latency: P95 < 50ms (excluding backend processing)
- Throughput: 10,000 requests/second per instance
- Connection Pooling: 1000 concurrent connections

### 2. Service Layer
The service layer contains multiple microservices, each responsible for specific business domains:

#### Authentication Service
Handles user authentication, session management, and token issuance.

**Responsibilities**:
- User login/logout
- JWT token generation and validation
- OAuth2 integration with external providers
- Session management and refresh token handling
- Password reset and account recovery

**Database**: PostgreSQL for user credentials
**Cache**: Redis for session storage
**Performance**: P95 latency < 100ms

#### Data Processor Service
Processes incoming data streams and performs ETL operations.

**Responsibilities**:
- Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources
- Data validation and transformation
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Data enrichment with external sources
- Output to data warehouse

**Technology**:
- Stream Processing: Apache Kafka
- Batch Processing: Apache Spark
- Storage: S3 for raw data, Snowflake for processed data

**Performance**:
- Stream Processing: 50,000 events/second
- Batch Processing: 10M records/hour

#### Business Logic Service
Core application logic and business rule processing.

**Responsibilities**:
- Customer order processing
- Inventory management
- Pricing calculations
- Business rule engine execution
- Workflow orchestration

**Database**: PostgreSQL with read replicas
**Cache**: Redis for frequently accessed data
**Performance**: P95 latency < 200ms

### 3. Data Layer
Persistent storage and caching infrastructure.

**Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 14
- Multi-AZ deployment for high availability
- Automated backups every 6 hours
- Point-in-time recovery (PITR) enabled
- Read replicas for scaling read operations

**Cache Layer**: Redis Cluster
- 6-node cluster (3 masters, 3 replicas)
- Automatic failover
- TTL-based eviction policies
- Used for session storage, API response caching

**Object Storage**: AWS S3
- Raw data storage
- Backup storage
- Static asset hosting

**Data Warehouse**: Snowflake
- Analytics and reporting
- Historical data analysis
- Business intelligence queries

## Service Components

### API Gateway (api-gateway)

The API Gateway is built on NGINX and custom Node.js middleware.

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic routing based on request path and headers
- Circuit breaker pattern for backend service failures
- Request deduplication
- Response caching with configurable TTL
- API key validation
- CORS handling

**Configuration**:
```yaml
upstream_timeout: 30s
max_request_size: 10MB
rate_limit: 1000 requests/minute per API key
circuit_breaker:
  failure_threshold: 50%
  recovery_timeout: 30s
```

**Scaling Strategy**:
- Horizontal scaling based on CPU utilization (>70%)
- Minimum 3 instances across availability zones
- Maximum 20 instances
- Auto-scaling policy: add 2 instances when CPU > 70% for 5 minutes

### Auth Service (auth-service)

Stateless authentication service using JWT tokens.

**Authentication Flow**:
1. Client submits credentials to /auth/login
2. Service validates against user database
3. On success, generates JWT with 1-hour expiration
4. Returns JWT and refresh token (7-day expiration)
5. Client includes JWT in Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. Services validate JWT locally (no database lookup)

**Token Structure**:
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "roles": ["user", "admin"],
  "permissions": ["read", "write"],
  "iat": 1234567890,
  "exp": 1234571490
}
```

**Security Measures**:
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor: 12)
- Rate limiting: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes
- Account lockout after 10 failed attempts
- IP-based suspicious activity detection
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support

### Data Processor (data-processor)

Event-driven data processing pipeline.

**Architecture**:
```
Kafka Topic (input)
  → Consumer Group
    → Validation
      → Transformation
        → Enrichment
          → Kafka Topic (output)
```

**Processing Stages**:

1. **Ingestion**: Consume from Kafka topics
2. **Validation**: Schema validation, data quality checks
3. **Transformation**: Format conversion, field mapping
4. **Enrichment**: Lookup external data, calculate derived fields
5. **Output**: Write to data warehouse or downstream topics

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid records sent to dead-letter queue
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Manual review queue for ambiguous records
- Alerting on high error rates (>5%)

**Scalability**:
- Consumer group with 10 partitions
- Each partition processed independently
- Can scale to 50 consumers
- Processing parallelism = number of partitions

## Data Flow

### Typical Request Flow

1. **Client Request**: HTTPS request to api.example.com/api/v1/orders
2. **Load Balancer**: Routes to healthy API Gateway instance
3. **API Gateway**:
   - Validates API key
   - Checks rate limits
   - Extracts JWT token
   - Routes to business-logic-service
4. **Business Logic Service**:
   - Validates JWT signature
   - Checks authorization for action
   - Queries database for order data
   - Checks cache first, database if cache miss
   - Processes business rules
   - Returns response
5. **API Gateway**: Caches response (if cacheable), returns to client

**Total Latency Budget**:
- Load Balancer: 5ms
- API Gateway: 15ms
- Network: 10ms
- Business Logic Service: 150ms
- Database Query: 20ms
- **Total Target**: P95 < 200ms

### Data Processing Flow

1. **Event Generation**: User action generates event
2. **Event Publishing**: Service publishes to Kafka topic
3. **Stream Processing**: Data processor consumes and processes
4. **Transformation**: Apply business rules, enrich data
5. **Storage**: Write to data warehouse
6. **Indexing**: Update search indices
7. **Analytics**: Available for reporting within 5 minutes

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication (REST APIs)

Used for request-response interactions requiring immediate feedback.

**Advantages**:
- Simple to implement and debug
- Immediate response to client
- Strong consistency guarantees

**Disadvantages**:
- Tight coupling between services
- Cascading failures if downstream service is down
- Longer latency for multi-service operations

**Best Practices**:
- Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Implement timeouts (default: 30s)
- Provide fallback responses when possible
- Cache frequently accessed data

### Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)

Used for fire-and-forget operations and cross-service notifications.

**Technology**: Apache Kafka

**Advantages**:
- Loose coupling between services
- High throughput and scalability
- Natural support for event sourcing
- Better fault tolerance

**Disadvantages**:
- Eventual consistency
- More complex debugging
- Potential for message duplication

**Event Categories**:
- **Domain Events**: OrderCreated, PaymentProcessed
- **System Events**: UserLoggedIn, CacheInvalidated
- **Integration Events**: ExternalAPICallFailed

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

All services are designed to scale horizontally:

**Stateless Services**:
- API Gateway: Can add unlimited instances
- Auth Service: Session state in Redis, not in-process
- Business Logic Service: Database handles concurrency

**Scaling Triggers**:
- CPU Utilization > 70% for 5 minutes
- Memory Utilization > 80%
- Request queue depth > 100
- P95 latency > target SLA

### Database Scaling

**Read Scaling**:
- PostgreSQL read replicas (currently 3)
- Read queries routed to replicas
- Write queries to primary only
- Replication lag monitored (alert if > 5 seconds)

**Write Scaling**:
- Connection pooling (max 100 connections per service)
- Prepared statements for performance
- Batch operations where possible
- Database sharding planned for future (shard by customer_id)

### Caching Strategy

**Cache Layers**:
1. **API Gateway Cache**: HTTP responses (5-minute TTL)
2. **Application Cache**: Business objects in Redis (15-minute TTL)
3. **Database Query Cache**: PostgreSQL query results
4. **CDN Cache**: Static assets (24-hour TTL)

**Cache Invalidation**:
- Time-based expiration (TTL)
- Event-driven invalidation via Kafka
- Manual purge via admin API

## Security Architecture

### Network Security

**Perimeter Security**:
- WAF (Web Application Firewall) at edge
- DDoS protection via CloudFlare
- Geographic restrictions (block high-risk countries)

**Internal Network**:
- Services in private VPC subnets
- No direct internet access for backend services
- NAT gateway for outbound connections
- Security groups restrict traffic between services

### Authentication & Authorization

**Authentication Layers**:
1. API Key at gateway (identifies application)
2. JWT token (identifies user)
3. Service-to-service authentication (mutual TLS)

**Authorization Model**:
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Permissions checked at service level
- Fine-grained permissions (e.g., read:orders, write:orders)
- Admin actions require MFA

### Data Security

**Encryption**:
- TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
- Database encryption at rest (AES-256)
- Encrypted backups
- Secrets stored in HashiCorp Vault

**Data Privacy**:
- PII data encrypted in database
- Audit logging for all data access
- Data retention policies enforced
- GDPR compliance (right to deletion)

## Service Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies

**API Gateway depends on**:
- Auth Service (for token validation)
- Backend services (for request routing)

**Auth Service depends on**:
- PostgreSQL (user database)
- Redis (session cache)

**Business Logic Service depends on**:
- PostgreSQL (application database)
- Redis (application cache)
- External payment API (for transactions)

**Failure Handling**:
- Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
- Graceful degradation (serve stale cache if DB is down)
- Health checks every 30 seconds
- Automatic service restart on failure
